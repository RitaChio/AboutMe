<h1>About Me</h1>
<div id="intro">
<p>Welcome to my webpage! Here, you'll get an inside look into my persoanlity, as well as my skills. I'll also share some of my products and advice as I coninue to work on my blog.</p>
</div>

<div id="para 1">
<h2>My Skills and Attributes</h2>
<p>I've dabbled into various job industries to get a taste of the world, ever since highschool. I love to go after my curiosities, and in doing so, I've learned so much.</p>
<p>I work with Gimp, Adobe Photoshop, and Corel Paintshop Pro for my photography. During my free time, I've come to find a strong appreciation for technology and the web. I began to study web developement and chose to pursue a career with it.</p>
<p>The skills that I have now go beyond what I've learned in the work force. I've accquired skills from life just by being involved with others, and with myself. Being well rounded helps in many ways to shape the personality you want to have. It all starts from having an open mind, and an active mind.</p>
<p>I've grown an ability to stay focused in any given circumstance. My life has had more boulders than I had imagined it would. In return, it's given me gold mines of skills and wisdom that I wouldn't get from books alone.</p>
<p>Drive and motivation to succeed continue to be on my list of skills, going on 4 years now. The reason I note that is because skills can evaporate the less they are used, and I constantly use my drive to avoid being complacent in life.</p>
<p>Languages are my skill. I would credit my ex husband for my Moldovan/Romanian language; and SoloLearn.com and Udemy for learning HTML5, CSS and Javascript/JQuery.</p>

<div id="para 2">
<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>I love to read. Reading opens so many doors. I read not for leisure, but for advice, self help and growth.</p>
<p>Moving is something I have to be doing as to not drive myself crazy or get depressed. It's also a way I clear my head and regain my focus to the big rocks.</p>
<p>This one sounds cheesy, but I love to learn. It restores my confidence like taking a swallow of cold water after running a marathon.</p>
